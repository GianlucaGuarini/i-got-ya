# I got ya

This script was made for fun to let stop my working colleagues fucking with my machine when I leave it unattended for a while.

It will automatically detect from any keypress a list of [blacklisted words](blacklist.json) to automatically put it in sleep mode (`pmset sleepnow`)

I have configured my machine to [start this script automatically on boot](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html).

This script it's meant only for personal and didactic use and it works only on mac.
